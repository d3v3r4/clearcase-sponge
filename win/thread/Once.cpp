 * This is the second simplest implementation for this logic I
 * could find. Basically this is a spin lock with three values:
 *
 * 0 - Has not yet been run
 * 1 - Have aquired the lock and need to call the function
 * 2 - The function has already been called
 *
 * Obviously, there is a simpler implementation where there are only
 * two states and the lock is always aquired, but having the third
 * state of "already called" makes the efficiency reasonable.
